	[floam] Not sure why this was reverted, if anything the docs should do the same thing here. You can omit the Arial, Helvetica if you think that's too explicit. See https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/issues/665 for the Blink and Roboto rationalization.
	[floam] I did forget to remove that comment citing the docs.
	[faho] See the next commit: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/commit/25e02ea07f8210308a281c01b4b31fdae6836e66
	[floam] Right, I thought what it had was better than `"Segoe UI", system-ui, sans-serif;`. Oh well
	[floam] (where the goal is more "I want the system UI font" than "I don't want a horrible sans-serif".)

		That rationale is from 2017. There is no need for it anymore. The font list we use now uses the system font with a single font as an exception, as a workaround for what is arguably a bug. For monospace that's not possible, unfortunately, for reasons explained in the docs theme.

		Really, the docs fonts are doing the right thing, this should be doing the same thing, now it is.

		Listing more fonts is **worse**, not better.
