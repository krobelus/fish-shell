	[mqudsi] I don't mean to bikeshed, but this is imho strictly worse because you alternate between using (strictly singular), long-form abbreviations for "minutes" and "seconds" then switch to two-letter abbreviations for milliseconds and microseconds. The actual results are always plural because they are floating point values and so are always as a part of a non-singular whole (1.000 would still use "seconds" and not "second"). Also, I think the change to using wide strings for an internal string does nothing but (negligibly) raise the memory consumption. Additionally, I'm not sure "millis" and "micros" are particularly unfamiliar? The entire patch seems to be a matter of bikeshedding, imho (although I do appreciate the second half of this patch series that uses the box drawing characters as that does greatly increase the professionalism of the output!)
	[floam] Man, if we are concerned about memory usage, we should stop storing parsed source for each function as wide chars. I changed it to accomodate the micro symbol.
	[floam] Feel free to revert if you think this commit was mistaken. I just thought it was an improvement.
	[floam] Note AFAIK the entire long-form verbose output units are actually dead code. We don't ever output that.
