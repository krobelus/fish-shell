 d0fe3fcb5 Add missing "--"
 ? no file 'None' in d0fe3fcb5ae3feca5827da7e4ee8f27a3749d3e5~..d0fe3fcb5ae3feca5827da7e4ee8f27a3749d3e5
	[mqudsi] @faho fwiw, `__fish_cargo_search` is gated behind `-n __fish_is_nth_token 2` and `__fish_is_nth_token` is terribly named but considers only non-switch tokens when counting and should (would?) return false if the current token started with `-` or `--`. Of course, someone might someday use `__fish_cargo_search` without that completion predicate, so by all means!

		(and, of course, +1 on silencing the `cargo search` errors)
	[faho] @mqudsi That's... not counting the current token (because it doesn't use `commandline -ct`).

		If the *current* token starts with a `-`, you get issues.

		```fish
		git checkout d0fe3fcb5ae3feca5827da7e4ee8f27a3749d3e5^
		source cargo.fish
		complete -C'cargo add --'
		```

		Yes, I did actually check that this was an issue, this wasn't just a speculative fix.
	[mqudsi] I've forgotten the intricacies of `__fish_is_nth_token`. My apologies.
