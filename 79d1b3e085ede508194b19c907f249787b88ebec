	[61746187] What does * do, and why do we use it?
		I'm not sure about applying this incrementally, since it leaves the documentation in an inconsistent state.
		Why not just fix all synopses in one commit? (if they need fixing)
		And then do all "``$LANG``" -> ":envvar:`LANG`" in the next commit, and the table change (with `|`) in another commit etc.

		Currently, I can't easily tell if these changes are a good idea because there is no (single) commit message to explain.

		I'm sure they're good changes, but I'd love to know why, so I can get things right in future. For example when to use double backticks or  double star?

		If we're in an inconsistent state, a doc_src/README would maybe help but it's better if we don't need to think about it.

	[61746188] the strip is unused, right?
