	[faho] Missed one on line 357.

		I would argue that the check should just be put back into handle_fish_use_posix_spawn_change, which allows you to check it once instead of in two places.
	[floam] The idea I suppose was now `handle_fish_use_posix_spawn_change` doesn't even need to be compiled in let alone triggered. Feel free to change it up however.
