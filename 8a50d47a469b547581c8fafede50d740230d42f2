	[faho] This doesn't seem right? The print_hints is defaulted to true, and we have calls to builtin_missing_argument without a print_hints argument.
	[faho] This calls builtin_missing_argument without providing a print_hints, so the default should be used which is true.
	[faho] Yup - running `bind -M` results in

		> bind: -M: option requires an argument

		with this, and

		>bind: -M: option requires an argument
		>
		>(Type 'help bind' for related documentation)

		without.
	[faho] Worse, running `fish bind.fish` with `bind -M` in it:

		```output
		bind: -M: option requires an argument

		bind.fish (line 1):
		bind -M
		^

		(Type 'help bind' for related documentation)
		```

		without, and just

		```output
		bind: -M: option requires an argument
		```

		with this. This should be reverted.
