	[floam] Unfortunately GIT_SHALLOW doesn't work quite right: [[ExternalProject] GIT_SHALLOW is not shallow enough](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/17770)

		Since we aren't even trying to track `master`, why not just fetch the archive? That should be quick.

		```cmake
		URL	https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/releases/download/pcre2-10.40/pcre2-10.40.tar.bz2
		URL_MD5	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
		```
	[mqudsi] I thought you meant `GIT_SHALLOW` doesn't work right as in fails to clone or doesn't do anything, but if it's just that it can be optimized further I think that's OK as it is still an improvement over the previous status quo. (Also, I think it doesn't affect us since - at least for now - pcre2project/pcre only has one branch (the master branch)).

		However, I agree with you and I was wondering the same thing since this adds an additional build dependency on `git` iff pcre2 isn't installed, and there's no good reason for that. I thought we weren't supposed to hotlink downloads from GitHub's primary URLs but I *think* they solved that problem. I'm not sure if, for example, BSD ports download tarballs from github.com or from raw.githubusercontent.com.

		(btw, I think you meant to initiate this discussion on c45fac84eed72586df77cea6f0193ffe949c0798, not this commit)
